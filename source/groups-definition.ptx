      Abstract algebra is build by taking familiar mathematical
      structure and, well, abstracting them: pulling the details of
      their structure <emdash/> their patterns, their arrangements
      <emdash/> away from their particular and trying to understand
      their general patterns. We start with number sets, which are the
      most familiar. What do number sets have? Well, a good place to
      start is arithmetic: they have binary operations with certain
      structure and patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most number sets have multiple binary operations: addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division. We'll get to abstractin
      of this level, but it makes sense to start at a more fundamental
      place. Therefore, let's just focus on one binary operation. We
      can think of the integers with just addition. We can think of
      the positive real number with just multiplication. These are
      sets with one binary operation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to the definition of a group. A group is the first
      and most fundamental abstraction of a set with a binary
      operation. Here are the details.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A set <m>G</m> with a binary operation <m>\cdot</m> is a
          <term>group</term> if it satisfies the following properties. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              The binary operation is associative.
            </li>
            <li>
              There exsts an element <m>e \in G</m> this is an
              identity for the binary operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each eleemnt <m>g \in G</m>, there exist an element
              <m>g^{-1} \in G</m> which is an inverse to <m>g</m>:
              that is, <m>g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e</m>. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          Since both the set and the binary operation are required for
          the definition, the formal way to refer to a group would be
          to write <m>(G, \cdot)</m>. Very often, the binary operation
          is understood from the context and we just use the set
          <m>G</m> to refer to the group. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      That's all we need: associativity, identity and inverses. In
      particular, we do not assume that the binary operation is
      commutative. If it is, we have a term for this. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group. If the binary operation is
          commutative, we say that <m>G</m> is a
          <term>commutative</term> group or an <m>abelian</m> group.
          If the binary operation is not commutative, then <m>G</m> is
          a <term>noncommuative</term> or <term>nonabelian</term>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Before moving on to the first examples, let me make a very
      important point about notation. I've defined a group using
      <sq><m>\cdot</m></sq> as the generic symbol for a binary
      operation. This is fine for the definition, but now that we know
      about abelian and non-abelian groups, there are important
      notation conventions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abelian groups are very often written using <sq>+</sq> as the
      binary operation. In group theory (and elsewhere throughout
      mathematics), addition is treated as the archetypical
      commutative operation, and we will often try to write abelian
      gorups using addition notation, even if this means extending the
      normal notion of addition. The point here is that the symbol
      <sq>+</sq> is very strongly associated with commutative
      operations <emdash/> when you see addition, you should think
      commutativity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, nonabelian groups are almost always written with some
      kind of multiplicative notation. The most common notation here
      is to drop the symbol entirely: if <m>g, h \in G</m> are group
      elements, then usually the operation is just written <m>gh</m>.
      This will be the convention that I stick to in these notes. When
      you see this notation, you should have the possibility of a
      noncommutative operation in mind. That said, many
      multiplications are still commutative, so there are no
      guarantees here in either direction.

    <title>First Examples of Groups</title>
    <p>
      Examples are, of course, very important to understanding what is
      going on with this abstract definition. Let's go through a bunch
      of examples. In addition to these examples, the next three
      section of this chapter are all devoted to another important
      example of a group.

        In <xref ref="definition-integers-mod"/>, I defined the
