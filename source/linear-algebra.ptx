  <title>Important Definitions from Linear Algebra</title>
  <p>
    There are some definitions and constructions from linear algebra
    which are worth reviewing. These will be useful for the course. 
  </p>
  <p>
    First, linear algebra happens in a vector space, so let me start
    with definition. As with polynomials in the previous section,
    where the coefficient were informally just <sq>numbers</sq> a
    vector space relies on some <sq>scalars</sq> which are numbers.
    I'll take the same informal treamenet here: scalars are numbers,
    usually real or complex. What sets of numbers (or other sets!) can
    serve as the scalar for a vector space? That is again an important
    question in linear algebra which we will try to answer later in
    the course.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A set <m>V</m> is a vector space if it satisfied these
        conditions.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The set <m>V</m> has a commutative binary operation
            written as addition. That is, vectors can be added
            together. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The set <m>V</m> allows for scalar multiplication: if
            <m>v \in v</m>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
