  <title>Some Notes About Proofs</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this late review section, I want to talk a little bit about
      proofs. This is an abstract pure mathematics course, so there
      will be a lot of focus on proofs. Proving theorems is what
      mathematicians do: it is our way of building the knowledge
      edifice of mathematics. It's important. Therefore, reviewing
      some ideas you hopefully have at least seen before is valuable
      to do. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a mathematical proof? It's any logical argument that
      proceed from some mathematical assumptions to a mathematical
      conclusion. It consists, usually, of both sentences and
      mathematical symbols. It start with the assumptions. It builds
      on them, often bringing in previous mathematical knowledge. It
      proceeds step by step, working towards the conclusion. Each step
      needs to be logically valid. Finally, it should be well written
      and clearly presented. It needs to be persuasive and
      understanding, which cannot happen without good writing in
      addition to good logic. 
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the general idea. In the rest of this review, I want to
      talk about specific techniques and styles of proof. These are
      all particular to various situation: most proofs don't
      necessarily fit into any of these particulars. That said, having
      some familiar structures can be very helpful in trying to write
      proofs. I'll start with some proof techniques. 
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
    <p>
      This is a pretty common proof technique. It proceed by assuming
      the opposite of what you want to prove. If that assumption leads
      to a contradiction or an impossibility, then the assumption must
      have been wrong. I can summaize this with a list of the piece of
      the proof. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          You want to prove some statement <m>S</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          You assume that the negation, <sq>not <m>S</m></sq>, is
          true. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Based on this assumption and other pieces of known
          mathematics, you proceed with a seris of logical steps and
          implications. 
        </li>
        <li>
          These logical steps eventually lead to something that cannot
          be true: a contradiction, an impossibility, something that
          is known to be false. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the assumption led to something impossible, the
          assumption must have been false. That is, <sq>not
          <m>P</m></sq> is false. Therefore <m>P</m> is true. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two important observations about proof by
      contradiction. First, it relies on a logical rule, which is
      called the <term>law of the excluded middle</term>, abbreviated
      LEM. This is rule which says that any meaningful mathematical
      statment must either be true or false. This is a sensible
      logical rule, and most of mathematics does operate under this
      rule. However, it is not without contraversy. Not all systems of
      logic allow it, and it is possible to do mathematics without
      LEM. In this kind of mathemaics, proof by contradiction is not
      allowed. There is also some very deep mathematical logic, which
      we won't get into in this course, but which conclude that even
      if you allow LEM and proof by contradiciton, eventually all
      mathematics systems will have statements that are neither true
      or false. This is fascinating mathematical logic, but for
      another course, sadly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, proof by contradiction is <term>non-constructive</term>.
      Often, proof by contradiction will tell you that some
      mathematical thing exists (because its non-existence would lead
      to a contradiction), but it doesn't tell you anything about how
      to actually figure out what the thing is. It makes a statement,
      but often the statements are difficult to work with. Accepting
      non-constructive arguments is a part of learning to aclimate to
      abstract mathematics: we can often prove some thing exists
      without having any idea about how to calculate it or determine
      its properties. And we live with this. 
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Mathematical Induction</title>
    <p>
      Mathematical induction is a technique for proving statements
      that are indexed by the natural numbers. Here is an example. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following statement is true for all <m>n \in \NN</m>. 
          <me>
            \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This proposition is not just one statement, it is infinitely
      many statment. It is all of these equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          1 \amp = \amp \frac{(1)(2)}{2} \amp (n = 1)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          1 + 2 \amp = \amp \frac{(2)(3)}{2} \amp (n = 2)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          1 + 2 + 3 \amp = \amp \frac{(3)(4)}{2} \amp (n = 3)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \amp = \amp \frac{(4)(5)}{2} \amp (n = 4)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 \amp = \amp \frac{(5)(6)}{2} \amp (n = 5)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \vdots \amp \amp \vdots \amp \vdots
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out this structure of a proposition is common enough
      that we have developed a whole technique for proving it.
      Mathematical induction is this technique. Here is the setup of
      an induction proof. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prove the base case. This is usually <n>n=1</n>, but this
          might start with any spot; sometimes the statement is only
          true starting at, say, <m>n=4</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary
          <m>k</m>. This is called the induction assumption. 
        </li>
        <li>
          From the induction assumption, prove that the statement is
          true for <m>n = k+1</m>. This is the induction step.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conclude that the statement is true for all <m>n \in
          \NN</m>, at least all after the base case. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why does this work? Well, the base case is true. Then, the
      induction step says that every case implies the following cases.
      So case 1 implies case 2. And then case 2 implies case 3. And
      then case 3 implies case 4. And then case 4 implies case 5. And
      so on, all the way through the natural numbers. In our logic, we
      accept this as a way to prove something true for all natural
      numbers. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Proving Equations</title>
    <p>
      Many proposition in mathematics boil down to just proving an
      equation: prove that <m>A = B</m> for some kind of mathematics
      things <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Though this is a common kind of
      proof, there is a pitfall here that is extremely common for
      students to fall into: reduction to equality. Reduction to
      equality is not a valid proof structure. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What do I mean by reduction to equality? I mean a proof that
      looks like this:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          A \amp = \amp B
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{something} \amp = \amp \text{something}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \vdots \amp = \amp \vdots
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{something} \amp = \amp \text{something}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \text{same} \amp = \amp \text{same}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      It's a proof that start with both sides of an equation,
      manipulates both, and ends up with a true equality at the end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So why doesn't this work? The full logical answer is a bit
      complicated, but let me give you a simple example.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          6 \amp = \amp 7 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          (0)5 \amp = \amp 7(0)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          0\amp = \amp 0
        </mrow>
      </md>
      If reduction to equality worked, then this would be a proof that
      <m>6 = 7</m>, which is obviously not true. The fact that the
      equality at the end is true does not actually mean the starting
      equality is true. This is a nice concise example, but
      multiplication by zero is not, in fact, the only problem with
      this structure: the logic here is suspect for many reasons.
      Therefore, this kind of proof is avoided. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So how to you prove an equality? You start on one side and end
      up on the other. The structure of the proof should look
      something like this. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          A \amp = \amp \text{something}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \amp \text{something}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \amp \vdots
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \amp \text{something}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \amp B 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      This is a valid structure. Assuming the steps on from each
      <sq>something</sq> to the next are valid mathematics, this is
      reliable. There are no logical pitfalls here. (Start on the
      right is, of course, possible as well. You could start with
      <m>B</m> and proceed to <m>A</m> in the same way. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>A Few Miscelaneous Proof Structures</title>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proving Set Equality</title>
      <p>
        Sometimes we need to prove that two sets are the same set:
        <m>A = B</m> where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets. According
        to <xref ref="definition-sets-basics"/>, two sets are equal
        if and only if they have the same elements. Therefore, to
        prove that two sets are equal, you have to prove that all
        elements of <m>A</m> are elements of <m>B</m> and
        vice-versa. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Formally, these statements are <m>A \subset B</m> and <m>B
        \subset A</m>. Therefore, to prove that sets are equal, by
        far the most common method is to separately prove these two
        statements: that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m> and that
        <m>B</m> is a subset of <m>A</m>. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>If And Only If Proofs</title>
      <p>
        Many proposition in mathematics are equivalences: <m>P
        \equiv Q</m>. In word, this is usually started that <m>P</m>
        is true if and only if <m>Q</m> is true. We often call these
        <sq><term>if and only proofs</term></sq>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove an equivelnce means proving both directions. An
        <sq>if and only if</sq> proof will always have two separate
        pieces. In the first piece, <m>A</m> is the assumption and
        <m>B</m> is the conclusion: you will argue starting with
        <m>A</m> and trying to get to <m>B</m>. In the second piece
        of the proof, this will be reversed: you will argue starting
        with <m>B</m> and ending with <m>A</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        An equivalence proof is not complete without these two
        steps. Even if the second part of the proof is the exact
        reverse of the first (all the steps of the first from
        <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> can be logically reverseed), such a
        fact still needs to be clearly stated to complete the second
        part of the proof. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proving by Example</title>
      <p>
        A common mistake is proving by example. Say you are asked to
        prove a statement of the form: all things of type <m>A</m>
        have property <m>P</m>. You cannot prove this by giving
        examples. The proof has to be general: the statement says
        that <emph>all</emph> things of type <m>A</m> have to have
        the property. Mathematics doesn't care about preponderance
        of evidence: no amount of example will constitute a proof. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, there are two place where proof by example is
        entirely appropriate. First, if I negate the previous
        statement, I get this claim: not all things of type <m>A</m>
        have property <m>P</m>. This can be proved by example, since
        find just one thing that fails the property means that the
        statement is true. Whenever you have to prove that some
        property is false, you only need one falsification (as
        opposed to proving it is true, where all possible instances
        have to be justified). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The second place is similar: existence statements can often
        be proved by example. Say you are trying to prove this
        statement: there exists at least one thing of type <m>A</m>
        with property <m>P</m>. This can be proved by example, since
        the statement only cares about the existence of one thing.
        You only have to find that one thing, that one example. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that when you have something that looks like the
        negation of a property or an existence statement, you should
        consider if an example is sufficient. I can't given you a
        full general rule here: this is proof, so there are always
        subtleties, strange cases, weird ways of phrasing claims,
        and so on. So I can't say that all existence proof or all
        negations can be done by examples. But I can say that you
        should thing carefully about such statement to see if an
        example is, in fact, sufficient for proof. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Proof by Cases</title>
      <p>
        Many statements in mathematics apply to a number of
        situations. Often, a proof can be split up into a number of
        cases. Say you want to prove something about positive
        integers, and what you are proving depends somehow on the
        factors. You may need different arguments for prime and
        compositive numbers. In this situation, you would break your
        proof into cases: a case for prime numbers, with its own
        arguments; and a case for composite numbers, with a different
        set of arguments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a general idea, but a good one to keep in mind. If you
        find an argument that sort-of work, ask yourself if it works
        for a certain subset of the objects under consideration. Maybe
        you can separate your proof into cases, where you idea works
        for a certain subset and other ideas might work for other
        subsets. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Lemmas</title>
      <p>
        For long proofs, the orginization of the proof can become a
        major challenge. Longer proofs often have many layered
        arguments which cascade into each other. Keeping track of all
        the assumptions and arguments can easily become daunting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to tackle this problem is with lemmas. A
        <term>lemma</term> is a small piece of a proof that can be
        separated from the rest of the proof, proved on its own, and
        then used in the proof. It is an organization structure to
        keep track. Often a lemma is use for an important technical
        detail of a proof particularly if that technical detail needs
        to be used multiple times. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Bijective Functions</title>
      <p>
        There are many proof in mathematics where the goal is to prove
        some function is bijective. According to <xref
        ref="definition-functions-jective"/>, a bijective function is
        both injective and surjective. To prove a function is
        bijective means proving both of these. Both of these pieces
        have common proof setups as well. Let <m>f:A \rightarrow B</m>
        be a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>f</m> is injective, the standard setup is to
        take two elements <m>a_1, a_2 \in A</m> and then assume that
        <m>f(a_1) = f(a_2)</m>. From this assumption, you try to prove
        that <m>a_1 = a_2</m>. If this assumption does actually lead
        to the conclusion that <m>a_1 = a_2</m>, then the function is
        injective. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that <m>f</m> is surjective, the standard setup is to
        take an arbitrary <m>b \in B</m> and then construct (or prove
        by some other means, often contradiciton) that there must
        exist an <m>a in A</m> such that <m>f(a) = b</m>. Since the
        element of <m>B</m> was chosen completely arbitrarily, this
        prove that all of <m>B</m> is indeed in the output of the
        function, which means that it is surjective. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Proof Writing</title>
    <p>
      Writing proof is one of the most difficult thing to learn in
      mathematics. In addition to figuring out the logical argument,
      you also have to figure out how to put that argument into
      language: how to structure you sentences and paragrpahs, how to
      describe the logic, what symbols and letters to use. All of this
      take practice, much like ordinary writing take practice. The
      writing of a proof can almost always be refined and improved:
      like all good writing, proof writing requires drafts and edits
      to produce a piece of quality writing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to make two concrete suggestions here. The first is
      that proof require great precision in your writing. There are
      many ways to write precisely and, again, it is a skill to
      practice. But to be concrete, the first advice is to be very
      careful with pronouns. Whenever you use a pronoun, make sure it
      is clear in the the writing what you pronoun refers to. In
      particular, <sq>this</sq> turns out to be a very dangerous word.
      It's very common in a prove to have sentences that start in this
      way:
      <quote>
        This implies that <m>\ldots</m>
      </quote>
      These are dangerous sentences: what does <sq>this</sq> refer to?
      In such sentences, a small adjustment can often help a great
      deal. Tell you read what you are actually referring to. For
      example, depending on what you are talking about, any of these
      would be preferable. 
      <quote>
        This induction argument implies that <m>\ldots</m>
      </quote>
      <quote>
        The existence of this function <m>f</m> implies that <m>\ldots</m>
      </quote>
      <quote>
        The argument in the previous paragraph implies that <m>\ldots</m>
      </quote>
    </p>
    <p>
      My second concrete suggestion is to be very careful with new
      symbols. Whenever you introduce a new symbol, make sure you tell
      your reader what the symbol is. If you want to use a new letter
      <m>a</m> as a real number, say
      <sq>Let <m>a</m> be a real number</sq> before you use it in an
      equation. Do the same for any other new letter or other symbol
      you introduce. 
    </p>

    <title>Using Previously Known Material</title>
    <p>
      Mathematics is a structure and builds on itself. High-school
      algebra relies on elementary school arthmetic, university
      calculus relies on high-school algebra, and so on through all
      the higher levels of mathematics. This is particularly true to
      proof: almost not mathematical proofs are just proved entirely
      from first principles. (A famous and ridiculous cases is found
      in Principia Mathematica by Russell and Whitehead. In this
      famous text, which tried to build all of mathematics out of a
      pure logical foundation. This book takes several hundred pages
      of intense and complex symbolic logic to get to basic
      arithmetic, such as <m>1 + 1 = 2</m>.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the challenges of writing proof in university courses is
      known what is considered <sq>previously known material</sq> for
      the purpose of this proof. So, let me try to clarify. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          The prerequisites for this course are Linear Algebra and, by
          the prerequisite chain, also Calculus I. Therefore, material
          from those courses is considered known material. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no other prerequisites for this course. However, a
          number of people in this course may have studied Discrete
          Mathematics. The material from such a course might also be
          considered known material, but I will not rely on this. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The material in this whole Preliminaries chapter is also
          known material for the rest of the course. In particular,
          set theory, relations, order, the set definition of
          functions: these may all be somewhat new to you. You should
          use the definition, propositions and theorem in this
          Preliminaries chapter as known material for the rest of the
          course. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Obviously, grade-school arthmetic and algebra are also known
          material. This can be a bit tricky, since particularly
          high-school curriculum varies greatly across different
          provinces and, particularly, different countries. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Other than this, all of the exercises and proof in this
          course will be self-sufficient. You will be able to prove
          them only using results already stated in the course. I
          would like you do to this: my expectation for the
          assignments in this course is that you work from the course
          material. 
        </li>
        <li>
          In particular, this means that using external resources
          becomes tricky. If you go looking for help on the internet
          (other texts, Youtube videos, etc), you certainly find
          people writing and talking about all the things in this
          course. But each of those people will have a different idea
          of what their known material is, which will necessarily
          affect how they talk, how they make argument, how they
          make proofs. Working with external resources will always
          mean figuring out not just their arguments, but what known
          material those argument rely on and whether or now that
          aligns with course. This is not impossible, but it can be
          difficult.
