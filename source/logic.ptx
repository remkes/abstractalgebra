  <title>Introduction and Logic</title>
    <p>
      Abstract algebra is a fundamental discipline in pure
      mathematics: much of the edifice of mathematics rests of the
      fundamental constructions of groups, rings and fields. However,
      abstract algebra itself relies on other fundamental pieces of
      mathematics.  In this preliminary sections, I'm going to quickly
      review these mathematical building blocks.

      This has the added benefit of setting the notational convention
      for the rest of these notes.

      Before even starting the mathematics, let me review some
      important notations from logic.
      <ul>
        <li>  
          The symbol <sq><m>\defeq</m></sq> means that something is
          equal by definition. Whatever is on the left is defined to
          be whatever is on the right. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\forall</m></sq> means <sq>for all</sq>.
          This symbol is called the universal quantifier. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\exists</m></sq> means <sq>there
          exists</sq>.  This symbol is called the existential 
          quantifier. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\exists!</m></sq> means <sq>there
          exists uniquely</sq>. This means that some thing exists, but
          there is only one such thing. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\implies</m></sq> indicates implication:
          what is before implies what is after. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\iff</m></sq> indicates two directional
          implication or logical equivalence: what is before is true
          if and only if what is after is also true. The phrase <sq>if
          and only if</sq> is very common in this situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The symbol <sq><m>\therefore</m></sq> indicates 
          what is after follows from the arguments or facts preceding
          the symbol. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also before starting even the mathematic review, I also want to
      comment on a few tricky terms. These terms are used frequently
      in pure mathematics and are often take for granted, but it is
      very useful to clarify them at the very start. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many definition in mathematics depend on choices,
          representatives, or some other variability. A construction is
          <term>well-defined</term> if is doesn't depend on any of
          these choices. Basically, well-defined means that the method
          of construction can be shown to actually work, that the
          definition makes sense and lives up to what is claim about
          it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Many things in mathematics are <term>indexed</term>. The
          typical way to indicate an index is as a subscript:
          <m>A_i</m> is some things indexed by the index <m>i</m>.
          Usually, the index <m>i</m> comes from a set: <m>i \in
          I</m>. This called the <term>indexing set</term>. In
          generally, any set can be an indexing set. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
