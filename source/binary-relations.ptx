  <title>Binary Relations</title>
  <p>
    The language of functions lets me give one of the most
    basic definitions of the course.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set. A function <m>f: A^2 \rightarrow
        A</m> is called a <term>binary relation</term> on <m>A</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This is, again, the abstract definition. What this function is
    doing is taking an ordered pair <m>(a,b)</m>, and from that pair
    producing one new element <m>f((a,b))</m>. This is an operation:
    taking two element and putting them together. This is a model
    for many of the basic operations of mathematics: addition,
    subtraction, multiplication and division are all binary
    operations (on appropriate sets). For this reason, binary
    relations are usually written like these arithmetic actions. For
    a general binary relation, instead of <m>f((a,b))</m>, I can
    write something like <m>a \cdot b</m>. The function gives a nice
    general set-theoretic way to define this idea. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Properties of binary relations are central to this course. Let
    me define them for you. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set with <m>a \cdot b</m> a binary
        relation on the set. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            If, <m>\forall a,b \in A</m>, <m>a \cdot b = b \cdot
            a</m>, the binary relation is called
            <term>commutative</term>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If, <m>\forall a,b,c \in A</m>, <m>a \cdot (b \cdot c)
            = (a \cdot b) \cdot c</m>, the binary relation is called
            <term>associative</term>.
          </li>
          <li>
            An element <m>e \in A</m> with the property that,
            <m>\forall a \in A</m>, <m>e \cdot a = a \cdot e =
            a</m>, then this element is called an
            <term>identity</term> element for the binary operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assume that an identity element exists. Then, for some
            <m>a \in A</m>, an element <m>b \in A</m> that satisfies
            <m>a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e</m> is called an inverse
            for <m>a</m> and written <m>a^{-1}</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Let <m>B \subset A</m> be a subset of the set. If, for
            all <m>a, b \in B</m>, <m>a \cdot b \in B</m>, then the
            subset <m>B</m> is <term>closed under the binary
            operation</term>. That is, whenever the binary relation
            starts in the subset, it always stays in the subset. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Now assume there are two binary operations, <m>\cdot</m>
            and <m>\star</m> on the set. If, <m>\forall a,b,c \in
            A</m>, <m>a \star ( b \cdot c) = (a \star b) \cdot (a
            \star c)</m>, then we say that the operation
            <m>\star</m> <term>distributes</term> over the operation
            <m>\cdot</m>. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
