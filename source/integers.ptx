    <title>Properties of the Integers</title>
    <p>
      Abstract algebra is going to take the familiar number sets and
      abstract them, pulling their properties away from the numbers
      themselves seeing what happens with the general ideas. To do
      this, I need to set a solid foundation of numbers. All the
      number sets will be useful in this course, but the integers are
      have a special central place. It's pretty valuable to review
      properties of the integers. A lot of this is review from many
      years ago: ideas that you originally may have learned somewhere
      in elementary school. That said, my definition will differ a bit
      from what you learned in elementary school; I do so in order to
      properly setup important definitions later in the course. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with one very important property of the integers,
      which I won't proof. (What a proof even constitute here is a bit
      tricky to say: this is almost by definition, depending on your
      perpsective.) 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The relation <m>a \leq b</m> is a total order on <m>\ZZ</m>.
          Similarly, the relation <m>a \lt b</m> is a strict total
          order on <m>\ZZ</m>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Then I can move on to the arithmetic of the integers. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Let <m>a,b,n\in \ZZ</m>. If <m>n = ab</m>, then <m>a</m>
              and <m>b</m> are called <term>factors</term> of
              <m>n</m>. The number <m>n</m> is called a multiple of
              <m>a</m> and likewise a multiple of <m>b</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The numbers <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> in <m>\ZZ</m> are
              called <term>units</term>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A non-zero, non-unit integer <m>n</m> is called <term>
              prime</term> if in any integer equation <m>n = ab</m>,
              one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is a unit. Equiavlently,
              <m>n</m> has no integer factors other than itself,
              excluding units and multiplication by units (meaning
              the factors are <m>n</m>, <m>-n</m>, <m>1</m> and
              <m>-1</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A non-zero, non-unit integer <m>n</m> is called
              <term>composite</term> it if is not prime. This means that
              there is a factorization <m>m = ab</m> where neither
              <m>a</m> nor <m>b</m> is a unit. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The <term>greatest common factor</term> of two integers
              <m>a</m> amd <m>b</m> is, unsurprisingly, the largest
              positive integer which is a factor of both. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The <term>least common multiple</term> of two integers
              <m>a</m> amd <m>b</m> is, again unsurprisingly, the
              largest positive integer which is a multiple of both. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now let me state, as theorems, two of the most important
      properties of the integers. I don't prove these here, but
      versions of the proofs of this will show up later when we get
      into similar concpets in ring theory.  
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n \in \ZZ</m>. Then there exists a unique list of
          positive prime integers (not necessarily distinct) <m>p_1,
          p_2, \ldots p_k</m> and a unit <m>u</m>  such that 
          <me>
            n = up_1p_2 \ldots p_k
          </me>  
          This list is called the <term>prime factors</term> of
          <m>n</m>. The number of times any prime shows up in the list
          is the <term>multiplicity</term> of that prime factor. (The
          list is only unique up to reordereing, of course.) 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <theorem>
      <title>Division Algorithm</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers with <m>b > 0</m>.
          Then there exists unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> with
          two properties.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <m>a = bq + r</m>
            </li>
            <li>
              <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m> 
            </li>
          </ul>
          The number <m>q</m> is called the <term>quotient</term> of
          <m>a</m> divided by <m>b</m>, and the number <m>r</m> is
          called the <term>remainder</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The division algorithm just states that division with remainder
      always works for the integers. This is obvious from elementary
      school arithmetic, but it is still one of the central facts
      about the structure of the integers, and one which becomes very
      interesting when we abstract the integers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The division algorithm is very useful. In particular, I can use
      it to calculate greatest common divisors.  This process is
      called the Euclidean Algorithm. Start with the two integers
      <m>a_1</m> and <m>b_1</m>. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the division algorithm to calculate the quotient and
          remainder <m>q_1</m> and <m>r_1</m>. That gives this equation
          <me>
            a_1 = q_1 b_1 + r_1 
          </me>
          Then set <m>a_2 = b_1</m> and <m>b_2 = r_1</m>. Then repeat,
          calculating <m>q_2</m> and <m>r_2</m>. 
          <me>
            a_2 = q_2 b_2 + r_2 
          </me>
          Then keep repeating. Each time this repeates, the next
          <m>b_i</m> is the remainder of the previous step. As a
          remainder, it satisfies <m>b_i = r_{i-1} \lt b_{i-1}</m>.
          The sequence of <m>b_i</m> is a sequence of positive
          decreasing number. It eventually gets to 0. If the last step
          has index <m>k</m>, it looks like this:
          <me>
            a_k = q_k b_k + 0 
          </me>
          From this, you can prove that <m>b_k</m> is actually the
          gcd. Just iterating the division algorith accomplishes this
          fact. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="definition-set-quotient"/>, I define the set
      quotient by an equivalence relation. Let me apply this now to
      the integer for the most important example.  
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a, b, n \in \ZZ</m>. If <m>a-b</m> is a multiple of
          <m>n</m>, then we say that <m>a</m> amd <m>b</m> are
          <term>congruence modulo </term> <m>n</m>. This is written as
          follows. 
          <me>
            a \equiv b \mod n
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is an equivalence relation on <m>\ZZ</m>. (Feel free to
      check the definition if you wish.). By <xref
      ref="proposition-equivalence-relation-partition" />, this means
      that the relation partitions <m>\ZZ</m> into equivalence
      classes. Since element in each equivalence class differ by
      multiples of <m>n</m>, I can write these classes as follows.
      <me>
        \{ \bar{0}, \bar{1}, \bar{2}, \ldots, \overline{n-1} \}
      </me>
      The notation for this set is <m>\ZZ/n\ZZ</m>, and it is called
      the integers modulo <m>n</m> (or just mod <m>n</m>). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The integers modulo <m>n</m> is a pretty important example for
      many parts of the course. It inherit addition and multiplication
      from the integers (again, feel free to check that these
      operations are well-defined<emdash />an excellent example of the
      use of that tricky term as well.)
