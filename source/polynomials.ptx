  <title>Important Definitions about Polynomials</title>
  <p>
    Polynomials should be relatively familiar from other courses,
    but it's still quite useful to review some definitions,
    notations and properties. 
  </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Often, the best way to write a general polynomial is using
            sigma notation. Let <m>c_i</m> be numbers, with <m>c_d
            \neq 0</m>. Then this is a polynomial:
            <me>
              p(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d c_i x^i
            </me>
            The numbers <m>c_i</m> are the <term>coefficients</term>
            of the polynomial; the expressions <m>c_i x^i</m> are the
            <term>terms</term> of the polynomial; and the number
            <m>c_d</m> is the <term>leading coefficient</term> of the
            polynomial. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I said that the coefficients were <sq>numbers</sq>. In
            general, the coefficient can come from a set <m>A</m>, but
            not just any set. What kind of sets can be used at the
            coefficients of polynomials? That's actually an important
            question in abstrat algebra and we'll answer it later in
            the course. For now, I'll be a bit informal and simply say
            the coefficients are <sq>numbers</sq>. These will usually
            be integers, real number or complex numbers. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The <term>degree</term> of a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> is the
            largest natural number <m>d</m> such that the polynomial
            includes a term with <m>x^d</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A polynomial of degree 1 is called a <term>linear</term>
            polynomial.  A polynomial of degree 2 is called a
            <term>quadratic</term>.  A polynomial of degree 3 is
            called a <term>cubic</term>.  A polynomial of degree 4
            is called a <term>quartic</term>.  A polynomial of
            degree 5 is called a <term>quintic</term>. These terms
            can be continued to higher degree if you want, but up to
            this point will do for our purposes. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A number <m>\alpha</m> is a <term>root</term> of a
            polynomial if <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. Equivalently,
            <m>\alpha</m> is a root if and only if <m>(x -
            \alpha)</m> is a factor of the polynomial. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The root <m>\alpha</m> has <term>multiplicity</term>
            <m>k</m> is <m>k</m> is the largest natural number such
            that <m>(\alpha - x)^k</m> is a factor of the
            polynomial. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A polynomial of degree <m>d</m> is called
            <term>monic</term> if its leading term is <m>x^d</m>,
            i.e., the leading coefficient is <m>1</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>A</m> is a set (of numbers, usually), then the set
            of polynmials in the variable <m>x</m> with coefficients
            is written <m>A[x]</m>. In particular, the set of
            polynomials with integer coefficients is <m>\ZZ[x]</m>;
            the set of polynomials with real coefficients is
            <m>\RR[x]</m>; and the set of polynomials with complex
            coefficients is <m>\CC[x]</m>. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Like with the integers ealier, I care about the arithmetic
    of polynomials. Again, there are some profound and important
    results that determine this arithmetic. 
  </p> 
  <theorem>
    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>p(x) \in \CC[x]</m> be a polynomial of degree <m>d</m>
        with complex coefficients. Then <m>p(x)</m> factors completely
        into linear factors. That is, there exist complex numbers
        <m>\alpha_i</m>, not necessarily distinct, such that this
        equation holds. 
        <me>
          p(x) = (x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)(x - \alpha_3) \ldots (x -
          \alpha_d)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Factoring polynomials is a large part of many algorithms. Knowing
    that factors always exist, at least if you are willing to use
    complex numbers, is, as the theorem says, fundamental. (Knowing
    the factor exist and actually calculating them, however, is
    a very different problem.)
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>Division Algorithm</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The division algorihm that we stated for integers also hold
        for polynomials. Let <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m> be
        polynomials with rational, real or complex
        coefficients. Then there exist polynomials with the same set
        of coefficients <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> such that two
        conditions hold. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>a(x) = q(x) b(x) + r(x)</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            The degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of
            <m>b(x)</m>. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        This is like the integer division algorith with only one
        difference: the remainder has a smaller degree (as a
        polynomial), rather than a smaller value (as a positive
        integer). Note that the division algorithm does not hold when
        restricting to polynomials with only integer coefficients. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    As we shall see in the unit on ring theory, the division algorith
    is as important for polynomials as it ever was for integers. 
  </p>

    I have one more definition and one more theorem for polynomials.
    These are both useful technical tools. This definition is a bit
    strange: I'm going to define the derivative. However, I'm just
    going to define it directly and only for polynomials: no limits
    or continuity needed here. Again, this is done for some useful
    technical reasons. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>p(x)</m> be a polymial, which I can write in sigma
        notaton. 
        <me>
          p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d c_i x^i
        </me>
        The derivative of the polynomial is written <m>p^\prime(x)</m>
        and defined to be this polynomial. 
        <me>
          p^\prime(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d i c_i x^{i-1}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This is just, of course, the power rule in each term extended to
    the entire polynomial by linearity. But I can define it this way
    without have to rely on the machniery of calculus, so I do. One of
    the uses of this is the following. 
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\alpha</m> be a root of a polynomial <m>p(x)</m>. Then
        the multiplicity of <m>\alpha</m> is at least two if and only
        if <m>\alpha</m> is also a root of <m>p^\prime(x)</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
