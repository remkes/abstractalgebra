  <title>Set Theory</title>
  <p>
    Outside of logic, set theory is the start point of modern
    mathematics. The review here is somewhat informal. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>set</term> is a collection of things, which are
        called <term>elements</term> or <term>member</term> of the
        set. If <m>a</m> is an element of a set <m>A</m>, the
        notation is <m>a \in A</m>. This is read as <sq><m>a</m> is
        a member of <m>A</m></sq>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sets can be defined explicitly as a list of elements.
        <me>
          A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}
        </me>
        Sets can also be defined by a property. 
        <me>
          A = \{a | a \text{ satisfies } \calP \} 
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>

    We have notation for certain special sets.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>\emptyset</m> is the empty set. It is the unique set
            with no elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\NN = \{1, 2, 3 \ldots \} </m> is the set of
            natural numbers. In some definitions, <m>0</m> is
            included in the natural numbers, but it will be
            excluded in these notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\ZZ = \{\ldots -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \} </m> is
            the set of integers. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\QQ = \{\frac{a}{b} | a, b in \ZZ, a \neq 0 \} </m>
            is the set of rational numbers. (Technically, I should
            also identity equivalent fractions, but this
            definition will do fow now.) 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\RR</m> is the set of real numbers. Usually, real
            numbers are represented by infinite decimal
            expansions. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\CC = \{a + b \imath | a, b \in \RR \} </m> is the
            set of complex numbers. The number <m>i</m>, by
            definition, has the property that <m>i^2 = -1</m>. 
          </li>
        </ul>

    Here are the basic operations and notations for sets. 
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="definition-sets-basics">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The notation <m>A =  B</m> is the equality of the
            sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Two sets are equal if and
            only if they have the same elements. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <m>A \subset B</m> means that <m>A</m> is a
            <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>: every element of
            <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>. If the two sets
            are not equal, then <m>A</m> is called a <term>proper
            subset</term> of <m>B</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <m>A \cap B</m> is the intersection of the
            sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>: the intersection consists of
            all elements common to both sets. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <m>A \cup B</m> is the union of the
            sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>: the union consists of
            all elements that below to at least one of the two sets. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <m>A \backslash B</m> is the difference of 
            sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>: the difference consists of
            the element of <m>A</m> which are not elements of
            <m>B</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <m>|A|</m> indicates the
            <term>cardinality</term> of the set: the count of how
            many elements there are in the set. If <m>|A| \in
            \NN \cup \{0\}</m>, then the set is called
            <term>finite</term>. Otherwise, the set is called
            <term>infinite</term>.

        </ul>

    Now that we have sets, we can make a variety of useful
    constructions from sets. All of these will be useful for
    buildings the objects of abstract algebra. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>Cartesian product</term> of two sets <m>A</m> amd
        <m>B</m> is written <m>A \times B</m>. It is the set of
        ordered pairs:
        <me>
          A \times B \defeq \{(a,b) | a \in A, b \in B\}
        </me>
        The catesian product can be iterated to product longer
        ordered lists. 
        <me>
          A \times B \times C \defeq \{(a,b,c) | a \in A, b \in B, c
          \in C\}
        </me>
        The caretian product of a set with itself is writen with an
        exponent: <m>A \times A = A^2</m>, and likewise for
        iterations: <m>A^n</m>. The familiar notations for Euclidean
        space, <m>\RR^2</m>, <m>\RR^3</m>, <m>\RR^n</m>, are
        examples of this notation.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set. The <term>power set</term> of <m>A</m>
        is the set of all subset of <m>A</m>. It is written
        <m>\calP(a)</m>.

        A <term>relation</term> on the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is

    </statement>

  <p>
    This is a very general and abstract defintion: intuitive
    <sq>relations</sq> between sets are usually very particular
    subsets of the cartesian product. However, having this level of
    generalize and abstraction in the definition is very useful.
    This will become a theme in the course: the power of taking a
    difficult and abstract definition and understanding the property
    of the definition on such a level.

        There are many types of relations most of which are defined
        on the product of a set with itself. Let <m>R \subset
        A^2</m> be a relation. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>reflexive</term> if, <m>\forall a
            \in A</m>, <m>(a,a) \in R</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>symmetric</term> if, <m>\forall
            a,b \in A</m>,  <m>(a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>transitive</term> if, <m>\forall
            a,b,c \in A</m>, <m>(a,b) \in R</m> and <m>(b,c) \in
            R</m> imply that <m>(a,c) \in R</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>connected</term> if,  <m>\forall
            a,b, \in A</m>, either <m>(a,b) \in R</m> or <m>(b,a) \in R
            </m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>anti-symmetric</term> if,
            <m>\forall a,b,c \in A</m>,  <m>(a,b)
            \in R</m> and <m>(b,a) \in R</m> imply that <m>a =
            b</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>asymmetric</term> if,
            <m>\forall a,b \in A</m>, it is impossible that both
            <m>(a,b) \in R</m> and <m>(b,a) \in R</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The relation is <term>irreflexive</term> if,

          </li>
          <li>
            A relations which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive
            is called an <term>equivalence relation</term>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A relation which is reflexive, transitive, and
            anti-symmetric is called a <term>partial order</term>. A
            set with a partial order is called a
            <term>partially-ordered set</term>. This is usually
            shortened to <term>poset</term>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A relation which is reflexive, transitive,
            anti-symmetric, and connected is called a <term>linear
            order</term> or a <term>total order</term>. A set with a
            linear order is called an <term>ordered set</term>

            A relation which is irreflexive, transitive, and
            asymmetric is called a <term>strict order</term>.

          <li>
            A relation which is irreflexive, transitive,
            asymmetric, and connected is called a <term>strict linear

    Equivalence relations are going to be a particularly important in
    this course. Let me give you some more information about how
    these relations work. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set with an equivalence relation
        <m>\sim</m> (so that the relation between two elements is
        written <m>a \sim b</m> instead of just <m>(a,b)</m>). Let
        <m>a \in A</m>. The <term>equivalence class</term> of
        <m>a</m> is the set of all element <m>b \in A</m> such that
        <m>a \sim b</m>. It is often written <m>\bar{a}</m> or
        <m>[a]</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    To state the important fact about equivalence relations, I need
    one more set-theory definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set. A <term>partition</term> of the set
        <m>A</m> is a collection of subsets <m>A_i</m>, where <m>i
        \in I</m> ranges over some indexing set, with the following
        two properties. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <m>\forall A</m>, <m>\exists i \in I</m> such that <m>a
            \in A_i</m>. That is, the subsets cover the entire set
            <m>A</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>\forall i,j \in I</m>, if <m>i \neq j</m> then <m>A_i
            \cap A_j = \emptyset</m>. That it, the subsets are all
            disjoint, with no overlap. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition-equivalence-relation-partition">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set with an equivalence relation
        <m>\sim</m>. Then the equivalence classes form a partition
        of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        There are two propreties of a partition, so I need to prove
        them both. I'll start with the first: I need to prove that
        the equivalence classes cover the original set. Let <m>a in
        A</m>. Then one of the equivalence classses is the class
        <m>\bar{a}</m> and <m>a \in \bar{a}</m> since, by the
        reflexivity of an equivalence relation, <m>a \sim a</m>.
        That finishes the first property: every element of the set
        is in at least one equivalence class. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I need the second part: that the equivalence classes
        are disjoint. Let <m>\bar{a}</m> and <m>\bar{b}</m> be two
        equivalence classes. Assume <m>\bar{a} \neq \bar{b}</m>.
        Then take any <m>c \in \bar{a}</m>. By definition, this means
        <m>a \sim c</m> (and <m>c \sim a</m> by the symmetry of
        equivalence relations). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, for the sake of contradiction, assume that <m>c \in
        \bar{b}</m> as well. This means that <m>b \sim c</m>. Using
        transitivity, <m>b \sim c</m> and <m>c \sim a</m> implies <m>b
        \sim a</m>. But this means that everything in <m>\bar{a}</m>,
        which is related to <m>a</m>, is also related to <m>b</m>,
        again by transitivity, and by symmetry I can revserse this
        to say that anything related to <m>b</m> is related to
        <m>a</m>. But this means that <m>\bar{a} = \bar{b}</m>,
        since the equivalence classes are, by definition, all things
        related to the representative. This is a contradiction to
        the assumpion that <m>\bar{a} \neq \bar{b}</m>. By
        contradiction, the assumption that <m>c \in \bar{b}</m> must
        be false. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So I have prove that any <m>c \in \bar{a}</m> cannot be in
        <m>\bar{b}</m>. Since the interection is defined to be the
        common elements, this implies that <m>\bar{a} \cap \bar{b} =
        \emptyset</m>. This completes the proof. 
      </p>
    </proof>

        Let <m>A</m> be a set with an equivalence relation

    The most important kind of relation is surely a function. Here
    is the formal, abstract definition. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A relation <m>R \subset A \times B</m> is called a
        <m>function</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> if, <m>forall a
        \in A</m>, there is exactly one <m>b \in B</m> such that
        <m>(a,b) \in R</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions have a number of associated notation and
        definitions. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The function is often written <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>(a,b)</m> is an element of the relation defining a
            function, then usually this is written <m>f(a) = b</m>.
            This can be used to defined the function: if I define
            <m>f(a)</m> by some process, that is equivalent to saying
            that the pair <m>(a,f(a)</m> is in the relation defining
            the function. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A function can also be called a <term>map</term> or 
            <term>mapping</term>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The set <m>A</m> is called the <term>domain</term> of
            the function, and the set <m>B</m> is called the
            <term>codomain</term> of the function.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tet set <m>\{ b \in B | \exists (a,b) \in R\}</m> is
            called the <term>range</term> or <term>image</term>  of
            the function. It is often written <m>f(A)</m>.

    </statement>
  </definition>

    The most important operation on functions is composition. I'll
    give the abstract relation-based definition here, even though
    composition is almost always through of as doing functions in
    sequence, one after the other. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> and <m>g: B \rightarrow C</m>
        be function. The composition of the two function is a new
        function<m>g \circ f: A \rightarrow C</m>. It is defined
        this way: whenever <m>(a,b)</m> is in the relation defining
        <m>f</m> and <m>(b,c)</m> is in the relation defining
        <m>g</m>, then <m>(a,c)</m> is in the relation defining the
        composition. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Next, let me define a very important function.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set. The <term>identity function</term> on
        the set A is written <m>\Id_A</m> and defined by the
        property <m>\forall a \in A, \Id_A(a) = a</m>. Often when
        the set it understood, the subscript is dropped that the
        identity function is just written <m>\Id</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    There are a number of important properties of functions to
    mention here. These are general set-theoretic properties. In
    other setting, function can many properties: continuous, linear,
    differentiable, increasing, decreasing, bounded, integrable,
    analytic, etc. All of these propreties rely on special structure
    on the domain and codomain; for now, I'll just give the
    definition that only depend on the basic set theory we've done
    so far. 
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="definition-functions-jective">

            <m>f</m> is <term>bijective</term> if it is both
            injective and surjective. A bijection function is in

            inverse function</term> <m>f^{-1}</m> such that <m>f
            \circ f^{-1} = \Id_B</m> and <m>f^{-1} \circ f =
            \Id_A</m>. (In general, both directions of this
            composition need to be stated!)

    Particularly for group theory, a certain class of bijective
    functions are very important.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set. A bijection function <m>f: A
        \rightarrow A</m> is called a <term>permutation</term> of
        the set <m>A</m>.

    Bijective functions allow me to say some interesting things
    about infinite sets. There is a great deal of mystery and
    subtlety in the cardinality of infinite set, but I'll just
    scratch the surface here with the definition that we need for
    this course. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an infinite set. If there exists a bijection
        <m>f: A \rightarrow \NN</m>, then <m>A</m> is called
        <term>countably infinite</term>. If not such bijection
        exists (that is, if you can prove that it is impossible to
        build one), then the set if called <term>uncountably
        infinite</term>. A set is simply called
        <term>countable</term> if it is either finite or countable
        infinite.
